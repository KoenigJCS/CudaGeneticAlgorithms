### GA
The GA functions largely the same as a normal GA, although an induvidual is implemented as a struct instead of a class for reasons seen later.
*This can also be split into multiple files easily, my Visual Studio Instance was giving me trouble on compiling.*

### Conceptual Idea
1. Standard GA Runtime INIT+CHC Crossover Population
2. Memory contining inudivduals is coppied to the GPU
3. Instead of a standard Eval (IF GPU option enum is set), a call is made to the GPU for the eval function
4. Induviduals are coppied back with updated fitness
5. Algorithm continues

### Implementation Details
This is the EvalGPU Call
```
 cudaMemcpy(members_d,members,size,cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
 EvalGPU<<<(options.popSize*2+255)/256, 256>>>(members_d,options.popSize*2);
	cudaMemcpy(members,members_d,size,cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
```
This coppies the data from the members array (The array of Induviduals) to the GPU. Note that size is computed above via
```
size_t size = options.popSize*2*sizeof(Individual);
```
**Note that it is very important to treat this like malloc or memcpy** as any internal pointers will not be deep copied, and an array can only be coppied easily if it is staticly allocated with non-pointer data (such as structs), wheras classes if if contained in the array via pointers will not be coppied.
Then ```EvalGPU<<<(options.popSize*2+255)/256, 256>>>(members_d,options.popSize*2)``` is called which is a ```__global__``` function and is passed as follows ```<<<numbOfCores,numbOfThreads>>>(standardFuncArgs);```

### Setup
1. Download NVIDA CUDA Tools: [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
2. Instal
3. Make sure your NVIDIA Drivers are up to date
4. Place CHCGeneticAlgorithm.cu into visual studio, (it should integrate it into the .sln file) otherwise try VSCode and run the compile manually.
5. Run the exe on the command line and give it whatever runtime args you want for the GA *Currently not implemented :(*
6. Check Results in outfile 

### Aditional Notes
- NSIGHT COMPUTE is very useful for seeing gpu errors general debugging.
- This requires a NVIDA GPU to run.
- ```extern std::mt19937 MyRandom;``` flips out, unsure why
